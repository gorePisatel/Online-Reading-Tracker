# Online Reading Tracker

Online Reading Tracker is a Django web application for browsing books, reading
books in a simple reader, tracking personal reading progress, and leaving
reviews.

The project combines:

- Django Templates for the frontend;
- Django forms for user interaction;
- Django REST Framework for API endpoints;
- token-based API authentication;
- SQLite for local development;
- Postman requests for API testing.

| Delete book | `/<book_id>/delete/` |
| Register | `/auth/register/` |
| Login | `/auth/login/` |
| Logout | `/auth/logout/` |
| Profile | `/auth/profile/` |
| Settings | `/auth/settings/` |
| My Library | `/my-library/` |
| Add to library | `/my-library/add/<book_id>/` |
| Update progress | `/my-library/progress/<progress_id>/` |
| Create review | `/my-library/review/<book_id>/` |

Important relationships:

- `Book -> Genre`
- `Book -> CustomUser` through `created_by`
- `ReadingProgress -> CustomUser`
- `ReadingProgress -> Book`
- `Review -> CustomUser`
- `Review -> Book`

- User profile/settings form.
- Book form.
- Reading progress form.
- Review form.
- Login form through Django auth views.

## API Endpoints

Base URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Users

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/users/register/` | Register user |
| POST | `/api/users/login/` | Get token |
| POST | `/api/users/logout/` | Delete token |
| GET | `/api/users/me/` | Current user |
| PATCH | `/api/users/me/update/` | Update profile |

### Books and Genres

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/books/` | Book list |
| GET | `/api/books/?search=1984` | Search books |
| GET | `/api/books/?genre=3` | Filter by genre |
| GET | `/api/books/<book_id>/` | Book detail |

Book API supports the `text` field, so book text can be created or updated
through Postman/API as well as through Django Admin.
The `total_pages` field is read-only and is recalculated automatically from
the book text.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/tracker/progress/` | Current user's progress |
| POST | `/api/tracker/progress/create/` | Add book to library |
| PATCH | `/api/tracker/progress/<progress_id>/update/` | Update progress |
| GET | `/api/tracker/reviews/` | Review list |
| POST | `/api/tracker/reviews/create/` | Create review |

Protected endpoints require:

```http
Authorization: Token your_token_here
```

## Postman

Export the tested Postman collection as `Collection v2.1` and keep it in the
repository, for example:

```text
postman/online-reading-tracker.postman_collection.json
postman/online-reading-tracker.postman_environment.json
```

The environment can contain:

```text
base_url = http://127.0.0.1:8000
token = your_token_here
```

## What Can Be Added Next

These are optional improvements. The current project already covers the main
course requirements, but these would make the demo stronger:

- Export and commit the Postman collection and environment.
- Add automated tests for auth, book API, reader progress, and review creation.
- Add pagination to the book catalog and review list.
- Add review editing/deleting for the review owner.
- Add "remove from My Library" functionality.
- Add API endpoints for reading progress from the reader, if it needs to be
  demonstrated in Postman.
- Add a favicon to avoid `/favicon.ico` 404 logs during local demos.
- Add production deployment notes if the project will be hosted.

## Demo Flow

1. Register or log in.
2. Browse `/`, search and filter books.
3. Open a book detail page.
4. Show the Description and Reviews tabs.
5. Add a review and show the updated rating.
6. Click `Start reading`.
7. Move several pages forward in the reader.
8. Open `/my-library/` and show that the book was saved automatically with the
   saved page progress.
9. Click `Continue Reading` and show that the reader resumes from the saved
   page.
10. Update reading progress manually.
11. Show API login and a protected API request in Postman.
